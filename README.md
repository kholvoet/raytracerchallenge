# KHolvoet's TypeScript Ray Tracer

This is a TypeScript implementation of a Ray Trace as described in [The Ray Tracer Challenge](http://raytracerchallenge.com/). 
The principal objective is personal development (in particular mine), with an emphasis on:

* (Finally) revisiting some of my favorite topics from a favorite graduate CS graphics class
